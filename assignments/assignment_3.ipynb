    "Write Python code that will read in five pressures from a file called pressures.dat and compute the average. If the average of the pressures is greater than 1020 hPa alert that pressure is high, if it is lower than 1000 hPa alter that the pressure is low, otherwise alert that the pressure is normal. Collect a random sample of 100 pressure values and compute the average pressure. Pressures in the file are in hPa.\n",

Report the actual SOI value, the month and year it occurred, and whether this is indicative of El Nino or La Nina conditions over the period 1951 to current. Additionally, determine the maximum and minimum value SOI over the entire period, reporting the month and year they occurred in. Print the results to the screen.\n",

    "The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is a measure of the difference between sea level pressure in Tahiti and Darwin, Australian, which gives a proxy for shifts in the Walker Circulation and thus the El Nino – Southern Oscillation (ENSO). There are many other ways to define ENSO periods and a good resource for background information can be found at: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/why-are-there-so-many-enso-indexes-instead-just-one.\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    "* Break the problem down into smaller bite size pieces. For example, first write your program to be able to read in the input file and separate out the year column from the SOI data columns. Then work to find the global max and min values. Then work on finding individual months that can be classified as El Nino, etc.\n",
